# Task priority and related work (#197)

Task Manager decides scheduling priority from QA's impact facts; QA does not set queue order or accept an unrelated goal on the Manager's behalf. Every new task defaults to P2. Residual tasks enter the executable queue directly: there is no new backlog admission gate.

| Level | Evidence-based standard |
|---|---|
| P0 | Observed or credibly imminent major damage requiring immediate containment: ongoing data loss, credential exposure/unauthorized access, widespread core-service outage without an alternative. |
| P1 | A core goal or critical delivery is blocked and there is no acceptable workaround. |
| P2 | Ordinary planned work, final integration/acceptance, or bounded defects with an acceptable workaround. |
| P3 | Non-core polish, wording, or verification beyond the current required acceptance. |

QA reports occurrence conditions, affected scope, evidence, workaround and delivery impact. Manager must record a reason and evidence references; adjectives alone do not establish urgency. Unknown facts do not justify inventing P0/P1. Credible major risk may justify immediate containment.

## Queue contract

`tasks.priority` and `tasks.queue_seq` are persistent. Legacy tasks receive P2 and tickets in chronological creation order (ID breaks ties); opening the database again does not move them. New tasks receive a monotonically increasing ticket from the same SQLite transaction. The next eligible task is ordered by priority, ticket, then ID.

A changed priority receives a ticket at the new level's tail. A no-op change keeps its ticket. Returning from execution to a queued/retry state receives a new ticket when the retry is scheduled; it is not eligible until `next_run_at`. Unready review dependencies and not-yet-due retries do not hold up ready work. A running task is never preempted merely because another task has higher priority. After a restart, interrupted executions rejoin the queue; already queued entries keep their order.

Claim selection, project capacity and claim writes share a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. Competing claim callers cannot claim the same task or exceed project capacity. This does not introduce multi-primary control-plane deployment: existing single-instance engine recovery remains the deployment model.

## Manager planning and associations

QA observations alone do not create work. For a `pass_with_issues` result, a separate, bounded Manager run reads the original QA facts and a compact project task index. It can inspect matching same-project task records and submit one decision per residual:

- `new`: create a distinct task.
- `supplement`: append this discovery to an existing unresolved task; do not create another execution.
- `related`: create independent work and link the related task.
- `recurrence`: create new work linked to an earlier fix, without rewriting its acceptance.
- `none`: keep the residual as a suggestion in the acceptance record; no task is created or supplemented.

### Other people's issues and pull requests

Each item also says what the work would change and need. `target` is the existing issue or pull request of the repository it would change, `{"type":"none"}` when it changes none; omitted, it is the issue or pull request a review or reply task worked on, and none for other tasks. `author_request` quotes that object's author asking for the change, `maintainer_acceptance` says where a maintainer accepted the finding, and `needs` lists what the executor must be able to do (`edit_files`, `run_commands`, `github_write`). The planning input gives the Manager `reviewed_object` (its author, whether the bot opened it, merged or closed) and the executor's abilities, so it can keep such residuals as suggestions itself.

When the acceptance is recorded, the control plane refuses a follow-up it would otherwise create or supplement, records `followup_refused` on the source task with every reason, and leaves the residual in the acceptance record:

- `followup_others_work`: someone else opened the target (it is not a pull request in `bot_pull_requests` or an issue the bot filed for an Actions failure), and `author_request` is not found, at least 12 characters long, in that author's own words the control plane received: the title and body, and the comments or reviews that started tasks on it.
- `followup_object_closed`: the target is merged or closed, as the webhook recorded it (`review_objects`) or the stored copy says.
- `followup_maintainer_accepted`: the plan carries a maintainer's acceptance. A claim that only refuses work is taken as given; the author's request, which allows work, is checked.
- `followup_executor_unauthorized`: the executor, the `dev` role running the ordinary request (`task.request`) a follow-up becomes or the unfinished task it supplements, cannot do something in `needs`. Editing files needs that work type's `code` write and the role's file writes, commands need the role's commands, and GitHub writes need the role's write on the target's resource.

The framework-default plan used when the Manager is unavailable goes through the same check, so a classification outage cannot start work on someone else's issue or pull request either. This applies the base rule every role receives: the bot does not change an issue or pull request someone else opened unless its author asked for it there.

Titles alone never cause automatic merging. The plan is bound to parent task, candidate and contract revision, with the actual Manager run reference. Replaying a completed acceptance does not create another child. Different sources, candidate versions, impact facts, evidence, Manager reasons and an optional same-repository GitHub Issue URL remain in `task_relations`; `source_task_id` is not the only provenance edge.

A similar task that is running triggers a durable Coordinator request. Newly created related work waits for advice; the existing running task consumes notices at its safe checkpoint. Supplementing a running task requests coordination without stealing its claim. Neither path bypasses notice acknowledgement, candidate binding or fresh QA.

If Manager infrastructure/permissions are unavailable, the original QA result is retained, a deferred-planning event records the failure, and an explicit framework-default P2 plan admits the reported issues without a human gate. Bare verdict persistence without a follow-up plan remains observation-only, preserving the upstream proportional-delivery boundary. They can subsequently be ranked by their Task Manager or an authorized user; a classification outage is not a new business rejection. New external GitHub writes are not granted: issue publication still belongs to existing authorized work/publish tools; these associations can reference an existing Issue but do not independently create/comment on GitHub.

## Interfaces

- `POST /api/tasks/:id/priority` with `{priority:"P0"|"P1"|"P2"|"P3",reason}`; same project/task-write authorization as other task mutations.
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/relate` with `{key,task_id,relationship:"same_problem"|"related"|"recurrence",reason,evidence}`; active similar work requests coordination.
- Task details expose priority, queue sequence and relations; task lists support `priority=P0` through `P3`.
- Management commands `task.priority` / `task.relate` share these mutation boundaries.
- Task Manager tools `set_task_priority` / `relate_task` record decisions; the role's coordination/nomination permissions remain editable. Worker/QA roles do not receive these tools by default.

## Verification

`test/followup-ownership.test.mjs` replays the PR #416 case (a contributor's fork branch that maintainers may not edit) and covers the author's request, a bot pull request, merged, closed and accepted targets, missing executor permissions and `none`. Automated tests cover priority order, same-level FIFO, unchanged-priority stability, re-entry/ready dependencies, durable reopen, competing real Node processes, QA urgency injection being ignored, explicit Manager decisions, two-source supplementation, recurrence, active-work coordination, and scope protection. A Native tool-loop fixture covers QA facts → Manager plan → Coordinator advice → acknowledgement without accepting the child automatically. Browser coverage checks priority editing, persistence/audit and mobile width.

An isolated real Native/DeepSeek replay uses the actual OpenToday residual facts from task `4f2eed3b…`: three documentation discrepancies and their existing derived tasks. The Manager classified all three as P3, chose to supplement the three existing tasks, created no duplicates, and P2 `final-integration` claimed the next slot. This validates Manager decision-making and queue application on historical facts, not a new product implementation or fresh product QA. The experiment's original database/repository were not modified.

The implementation integrates the latest main-branch proportional-acceptance changes: QA should not manufacture work from cosmetic preferences or hypothetical future verification. The post-QA Manager/default scheduling plan is the distinct work-creation boundary requested in #197. Review dependencies use the shared readiness rule; a missing dependency is not considered finished.

A later live replay exposed a contradictory model plan (`action=new` together with an existing `task_id`), which previously created duplicate work. Plan validation now rejects that combination and asks the Manager to repair it using `supplement`, `related`, or `recurrence`. This is structural validation, not semantic title matching. A regression test fixes that boundary.
